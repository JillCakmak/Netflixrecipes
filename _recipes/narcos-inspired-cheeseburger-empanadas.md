### Methods

1. **Cook the aromatics:** In a large skillet over medium-high heat, warm the oil. Add the bell peppers and onions and cook, stirring occasionally until softened, about 4 minutes. Season with 1/2 teaspoon of salt and black pepper to taste. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute.
2. **Cook the ground beef:** Add 1 tablespoon of the oil and the ground beef into the skillet. Using a wooden spoon, break the meat into crumbles. Add the sofrito and season the ground beef with the garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, paprika, dried oregano, sazòn con achiote, plus the remaining 1 teaspoon of salt and a few cracks of black pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally until browned and the meat is cooked through about 7 minutes. Carefully drain off any excess grease from the pan. Add the tomato paste and stir until all of the ground beef is fully coated. Cook for an additional minute.
3. **Let the filling cool:** Remove the cooked filling from the heat and let it cool, for about 30 minutes. You don’t want the meat to be piping hot or your empanada dough will start to go haywire, but warm or room temperature is totally fine.
4. **Assemble the empanadas:** Line a sheet pan with parchment. Set aside. Place one of the dough discs on a clean work surface. Add about 2 tablespoons of the cooled filling and 1 tablespoon of shredded cheese to the centre, fold the dough into a half-moon, and crimp the edges with a fork to seal. Turn the empanada over and seal the other side using a fork (we want to make sure it’s super sealed so we don’t lose any of that yummy filling.) 

   Transfer the assembled empanada to the sheet pan lined with parchment. Repeat with the remaining filling and dough until all of the empanadas are assembled.
5. **Fry the empanadas:**  Line a plate with paper towels and keep it handy near your frying station.

   In a large 10-inch skillet over medium heat, add 1 1/2 cups of canola oil. Once the oil is hot (reaches 350°F), gently place 2 empanadas in the pan and fry until the dough is golden brown, 2-3 minutes per side. If the dough is darkening too quickly, adjust the heat so the empanadas can cook evenly.

   Set empanadas on the paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess grease. Repeat with the remaining empanadas.
6. **Serve**: Serve the empanadas immediately with your favourite burger dipping sauce, barbecue sauce, or crema. Empanadas are best when made fresh, but if you happen to have leftovers, refrigerate them in plastic wrap or in an airtight container for up to 5 days. Reheat in a preheated 400°F oven until warmed through, about 6 minutes.
